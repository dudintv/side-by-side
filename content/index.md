# Side-by-Side Framework Comparison

It helps you to compare code examples across different frontend frameworks (Vue, React) in a side-by-side format.

This site provides practical code examples following professional Best Practices. It shows how to implement the same features across different frameworks. Each example demonstrates real-world patterns, making it easy to:

- Compare syntax and approaches between frameworks
- Understand framework-specific patterns and best practices
- Learn new frameworks by seeing familiar concepts side-by-side
- Make informed decisions when choosing a framework

**Disclaimer:** All code examples intentionally **omit import statements** to keep them concise and focused on the core implementation. _In real applications, you'll need to add the appropriate imports for components, hooks, composables, and other dependencies used in each example._
