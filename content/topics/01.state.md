# Local state management

Local state is mutable data that belongs to a single component instance. It's the component's private memory.

### Why local state needs to be scoped?

- Isolation, Separation of Concerns — _to separate UI concerns from business logic_
- Encapsulation and Reusability — _to have independent state in each instance_
- Performance and Optimization — _allows frameworks to optimize efficiently_

Use local state for anything that affects one instance of the component _(form input values, toggle states)_. Use shared/global state for data that multiple components genuinely need to access _(user authentication, theme settings)_.

### Difference of implementation

## Non-reactive state

If data is not changed during component lifecycle — keep it non-reactive.

If you have **full control** over a variable — no need to make it reactive.
