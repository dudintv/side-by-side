# Computed property

A computed prop is a derived value automatically calculated from other data (props, state) that updates whenever its dependencies change.

### Examples

<MainExamples :examples="main" /></MainExamples>

## No caching

The simplest derived values can be computed every re-render without any extra complexity but with probable over-computing.

## Caching

## Writeable
